; #lang support.
;
; This is a language file intended for use with syntax/module-reader.  It gets
; loaded by ruckus/lang/reader.
;
; It can be a bit hard to see the forest for the trees in the code below, so
; here's a high-level summary.
;
; We want to lower the Ruckus design language into the Racket language.
; Ruckus's design language has these key differences from Racket:
;
; 1. The ruckus module is implicitly required.
;
; 2. Ruckus CSG forms can appear at the file's top level.  They are collected
;    into a design evaluation function instead of executing directly.
;
; After lowering, nearly everything at the top level of a design language
; module gets wrapped into the body of a function (called, internally,
; 'design').  Exceptions are made for Racket forms that, syntactically, cannot
; occur inside a function, like 'require' and 'provide'.  See below for a
; precise list.
;
; In addition, a design language module contains a submodule called
; 'ruckus-metadata'.  This is where Ruckus's symbolic names are provided, so
; that they don't conflict with names used in the design (or in other design
; language modules required by the design).  Currently, the following names are
; provided by the metadata submodule:
;
; - top-level-thunk: the design evaluator thunk, which can be used with
;   call-with-edsl-root to produce a design AST.

(provide
  ; Hide Racket's module-begin form from Ruckus.
  (except-out (all-from-out racket/base)
              #%module-begin)
  ; Substitute our own.
  (rename-out [ruckus:module-begin #%module-begin]))

; Redundant import, but required by all-from-out above.
(require racket/base)

  ; below.  This rewriter has the opportunity to act specially on these forms
  ; before they are expanded.

            (syntax->list #'(provide require))))
 
  ; Identifiers of forms that will be hoisted out of the evaluator thunk and
  ; into the module's top level.
  ;
  ; Note that any macro identifier included here must also appear in
  ; expand-stop-ids, or it will expand before we can inspect it for hoisting.

; Recursive macro helper for rewriting Ruckus modules into Racket modules.
